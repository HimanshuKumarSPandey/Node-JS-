First Application : Before creating an actual "Hello, World!" application using Node.js, let us see the
components of a Node.js application. A Node.js application consists of the following three
important components:
1. Import required modules: We use the require directive to load Node.js
modules.
2. Create server: A server which will listen to client's requests similar to Apache
HTTP Server.
3. Read request and return response: The server created in an earlier step will
read the HTTP request made by the client which can be a browser or a console and
return the response.
